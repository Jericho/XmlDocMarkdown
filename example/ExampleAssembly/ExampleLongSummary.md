# ExampleLongSummary class

This class has an exceptionally long summary. Even the first paragraph is really long, which is important to test because some documenters put a lot of information in the summary, perhaps not expecting that someone will ever actually generate documentation.

With multiple paragraphs.

And text weirdly between paragraphs.

```csharp
var someCode = new SomeCode();
someCode.Print();
```

```csharp
public class ExampleLongSummary
```
